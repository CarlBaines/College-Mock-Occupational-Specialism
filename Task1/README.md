Task1 of the Occupational Specialism was to carry out research in preparation for developing a proposal for the digital solution. As well as this, I had to produce a detailed proposal for the digital solution to meet the needs of the client and other stakeholders. My proposal had to include the business context, functional and non-functional requirements of the solution, the decomposition of problems that need to be solved, KPIs, user acceptance criteria, a description of the proposed solution and a justification of how it aligns with the needs of the client and whether it is lawful.
