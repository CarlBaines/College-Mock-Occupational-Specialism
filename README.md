# Y2-OCC
This repository contains the occupational specialism prototype I created based on the project's brief:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The software development company you work for has secured a new contract to develop a digital solution for a charity called Health Advice Group. The charity offers information and support for environmental health issues.Health Advice Group provides:• advice on how to deal with extreme weather temperatures• information on environmental health conditions and seasonal allergies (e.g. asthma, hay fever)• risk assessments for home environments.The client (the trustees of Health Advice Group) would like to develop a digital solution that provides:• weather forecasting to inform health decisions• access to a dashboard for monitoring air quality data • advice on how to deal with health matters affected by weather and environmental conditions.The client has done some market research to identify features that could be included in the digital solution. The potential features suggested by the client are:• personalised health advice based on location• accessibility features to support a wide range of user needs• a personal health tracking tool.

Requirements for the developed prototype:
-----------------------------------------
Develop a functional prototype of your proposed digital solution to meet the client’s needs.During development, make sure you:• implement secure code in at least two appropriate languages to implement front-end and back-end processes• gather and prepare appropriate assets to be used in the development of your digital solution• make use of, and document, iterative testing• document the iterative development process, including changes made to the solution during development• produce code that can be maintained by a third party• ensure a high-quality user experience• follow legal and regulatory guidelines and standards.When gathering assets, you need to record the sources you use in an assets log. Your log must:• record all the sources you have used• describe the content and its intended purpose• log the date on which you retrieved the information.Your testing documentation does not need to include details of every test carried out. However, it should demonstrate:• an iterative approach to testing• understanding of how to test inputs, calculations, validation, and processes using appropriate test data.
